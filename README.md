This is a React.js project which scrapes data from a WordPress site using the WP Rest API plugin. It is in a very early state - it will eventually be a mobile project built with React Native. You can see an early version here:

Began the project with Stephen Grider's ReactStarter framework. Then:

```
	> npm install
	> gulp
```


Then:

Installed ReactRouter:
sudo npm install --save react-router@1.0.3 history

Installed Fetch (native to Chrome) - install the polyfill to make it work in all browsers
Fetch also used in React Native
sudo npm install --save whatg-fetch (much better than jQuery/AJAX)

Installed Reflux.js
sudo npm install --save reflux

Installed Lodash
sudo npm install --save lodash
